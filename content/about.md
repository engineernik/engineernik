Welcome to the ramblings of Jonathan.

I don't have a clear vision of what this site will be used for just yet. Rest assured, writing origin stories of [REDACTED, to avoid spoiling *The Button*] is not a niche genre I intend on pursuing further.

When I'm not busy building a nuclear reactor (pinch me), I can be reached for miscelaneous conversations of every sort at [@rad_hardened](https://x.com/rad_hardened) on Twitter, currently known as X.

And, as one is obligated to state on The Internet: My views do not reflect my employer.

## Etymology

### Engineer

Someone who solves problems you didnâ€™t know you had in ways neither of you understand, while occasionally muttering, *"No, this won't do,"* as he tears off another yellow sheet of grid paper from its stack, crumbles it, and chucks it into a bin overflowing with terrible ideas.

### -nik

> The English suffix -nik is of Slavic origin. It approximately corresponds to the suffix "-er" [...] In the cases where a native English language coinage may occur, the "-nik"-word often bears an ironic connotation, as in the case of the terms coined for the failed rocket launch of the U.S. satellite rival to Sputnik, such as kaputnik, dudnik and flopnik among others.
