Welcome to the ramblings of Jonathan.

With only one post presently up (I've already outwritten most of my Twitter mutuals with Substacks linked in their bio), I don't have a clear vision of what this site will be used for just yet. Rest assured, writing origin stories of [REDACTED, to avoid spoiling *The Button*] is not a niche genre I intend on pursuing further.

Most of my essays will likey fall into one of these categories:
 - **Prosperity**. The desire to expand human flourishing drives almost every decision I've made pertaining to my career (and previously, my education). There's only so much I can work on at once (presently resurecting the Nuclear Age, formerly worked on Starlink to bring The Internet to the underserved), but I'd like to appreciate others working to improve the world, and commemorate technological and societial changes of the past.
 - **Education**. My parents gave me one that was far beyond average, but not perfect. While I'm quite a few life milestones out from having kids of my own, I'd like to build a repository of curriculums I intend on using on my future children to raise future Emperors and Empresses.
 - **Book Reviews**. More likely, I'll simply consolodate my learnings and thoughts into an essay that happens to reference a given book a few times. These days I mostly read 19th-20th century history, and occasionally pick up a sci-fi. I'm aware of how little I've read of The Classics, which I intend on addressing.
 - **Projects**. Over the past year, I've picked up woodworking. I quite like working with my hands, which is something I only sometimes do at work. I'd like to try my hand at other artsy hobbies. If I have time, I'll attempt to work on technical side projects that get me closer to the professional polymath I'd like to one day become.

I can be reached for miscelaneous conversations of every sort at [@rad_hardened](https://x.com/rad_hardened) on Twitter, currently known as X.

And, as one is obligated to state on The Internet: My views do not reflect my employer.

## Etymology

### Engineer

Someone who solves problems you didnâ€™t know you had in ways neither of you understand, while occasionally muttering, *"No, this won't do,"* as he tears off another yellow sheet of grid paper from its stack, crumbles it, and chucks it into a bin overflowing with terrible ideas.

### -nik

> The English suffix -nik is of Slavic origin. It approximately corresponds to the suffix "-er" [...] In the cases where a native English language coinage may occur, the "-nik"-word often bears an ironic connotation, as in the case of the terms coined for the failed rocket launch of the U.S. satellite rival to Sputnik, such as kaputnik, dudnik and flopnik among others.
